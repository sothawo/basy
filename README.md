# basy

small test and example for a event source based banking system using cqrs (research project)

## Apache Kafka

the scripts in the *scripts* directory need to have the standard apache kafka distribution configured with the *bin* 
subdirectory as KAFKA_DIR. For example on my machine

    export KAFKA_DIR=~/tmp/apache-kafka/kafka_2.11-0.11.0.0

These samples use the default kafka installaiton arguments (ports, configs)
